# html-portfolio
A collection of my first HTML projects, including the Anime-Ranking Project, which features my top three favorite anime, and the Birthday Invite project, a simple HTML-based birthday invitation page. These projects showcase my foundational skills in HTML and web design, serving as a starting point for my journey in web development.
