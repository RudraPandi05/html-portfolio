<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Hey, I’m Rudra! I’m 20 years old and currently studying at SIES GST College, where I’m pursuing an engineering degree in the AI & ML branch. I’m super passionate about technology, and alongside my degree, I’m diving into web development and learning Python to build my skills in the tech world.</h3>
<h3>When I’m not studying, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new coding projects, reading up on the latest trends in AI, or just exploring cool tech innovations. I’m always looking for ways to improve and take on new challenges, both in academics and personal growth.

Looking ahead, I’m excited about how AI and machine learning can shape the future, and I can’t wait to contribute to that transformation in my own way!</h3>
